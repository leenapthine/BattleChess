# ♟️ BattleChess

Battle Chess is a strategy game developed in C++ using the SFML library. The game features various classes and files to represent chess pieces and game mechanics.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of C++ by developing a chess program from scratch. What started as a simple chess game has evolved into an ambitious project featuring multiple classes of unique pieces, each with their own special abilities. The game is a work in progress, with additional features planned, including a point system, strategic army development, a tutorial, and online multiplayer capabilities.

Artwork and design we're handled on my own and are harken back to the dungeon pixel aesthestic of the eighties. I will likely circle back on it in the future.

It was later further developed for the web using JavaScript, SolidJS, PixiJS, and Django. For that project, head [here](https://github.com/leenapthine/BattleChess-web) or try the game at: https://battle-chess-web.vercel.app.
